An app to help you keep track of your workouts and which excercises you are doing. Set a timer for however long you like and a sound will play a few seconds before the next excercise or rest set starts. You can delete and reorder your excercises as well as soon be able to save your entire workouts!

About this project

This is a project that I wanted to start because I liked going to the gym. The premise of this app is to keep track of time inbetween sets and reps. I know that there are a million types of these apps and that's why I wanted to make one of my own. It is one of those "If you can do it I can do it better" kind of deals, but among the many things developing Reps and Rest has taught me is that good quality software is hard and *very* time consuming.

There is still a million things I want to do with this app. The priority right now is trying to implement a way to save workouts and have a list of them so a user can for example have a list saved like `Ab pulvizer`, `Arms`, `Back/biceps`. After that, there will be a ton of UI enhancements!
